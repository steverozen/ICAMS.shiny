```

## Introducdtion

The function of the tab "Generate spectrum catalogs from VCFs" is,
well, to generate spectrum catalogs from VCFs and also to plot
the spectra.

The main input area is this

```{r VCFinput, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("VCF.input.screen.png")
```

It is necessary to select one item from each input
radio button, and then select one or more
VCF Files (variant call files) for upload.
