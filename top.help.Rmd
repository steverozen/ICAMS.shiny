The [mSigAct web server](https://msigact.ai) provides methods for analyzing mutational 
signatures. "mSigAct" is an abbreviation of 
<big><strong>m</strong></big>utational 
<big><strong>Sig</strong></big>nature <big><strong>Act</strong></big>ivity. 
We usually view a mutational signature as the pattern of mutations generated 
by a particular 
mutational process. For example:

#### Mutations from CG to TG
These are kind of "single base substitution" (SBS)
caused by deamination of 5-methyl cytosine.
We most often look at
SBS mutations in the context of preceding and following bases. We also, by convention,
always look a mutations from C or T (we reverse complement if necessary).
```{r SBS1, echo=FALSE, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=9 }
par(mar=c(6,6,4,1))
par(cex = 0.8)
ICAMS::PlotCatalog(PCAWG7::signature$genome$SBS96[ , "SBS1", drop = FALSE])
```

##### Different kinds of SBS signatures

#### Moderately-sized deletions with microhomology
These are common in tumors with defective 
homologous-recombination-based DNA-damage repair, often 
BRCA1 or BRCA2-deficieint tumors.
```{r ID6, echo=FALSE, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=9 }
par(mar=c(5,6,4,1))
par(cex = 0.8)
ICAMS::PlotCatalog(PCAWG7::signature$genome$ID[ , "ID6", drop = FALSE])
```

#### CC to TT mutations
These are a kind of 
of "doublet base substitution", (DBS)
mutations that stem from ultraviolet-radiation-induced pyrimidine dimers.
```{r DBS1, echo=FALSE, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=9 }
par(mar=c(5,6,4,1))
par(cex = 0.9)
ICAMS::PlotCatalog(PCAWG7::signature$genome$DBS78[ , "DBS1", drop = FALSE])
```

A single tumor or tissue sample usually contains mutations generated by
multiple mutational processes, each of which generates mutations that
when combined constitute the mutational spectrum of the sample.
For example, this breast cancer has XXXXX

```{r mutograph, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("mutograph.png")
```

## The [mSigAct web server](https://msigact.ai) can create and plot mutational spectrum catalogs from variant call files

Please see XXXXX for more information and examples.

## The [mSigAct web server](https://msigact.ai) can estimate mutational signature activities

The other group of functions deals with inferring mutational signature 
_activities_ in
individual mutational spectra. By "mutational signature activities
we refer to the numbers of mutations generated by each
mutational signature (or more precisely, generated by each
mutational process)
